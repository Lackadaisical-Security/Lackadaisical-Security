# 👻 Ghost Protocol Supporters

*"Those who support the mission without claiming the work"*

## The Philosophy

**Financial supporters are recognized here with gratitude.**

**However**: Support does NOT equal research credit. Donors are acknowledged as **patrons of the work**, not co-authors or contributors to the decipherment itself.

**All decipherment credit remains with the researchers.**

## 💬 The Distinction

**You're supporting the research, not claiming it.**

Like a museum patron or academic grant - you enable the work, but the discoveries remain credited to the researchers.

**This is how it should be.**

*"Support the mission. Let the researchers claim the credit. Ghost Protocol."*
