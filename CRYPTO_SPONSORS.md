# 👻 Ghost Protocol Supporters

*"Those who support the mission without claiming the work"*

---

## The Philosophy

**Financial supporters are recognized here with gratitude.**

**However**: Support does NOT equal research credit. Donors are acknowledged as **patrons of the work**, not co-authors or contributors to the decipherment itself.

**All decipherment credit remains with the researchers.**

### After Sending Crypto:

**Option 1: Get Recognized as a Supporter**

1. Open an issue in [this repo](https://github.com/Lackadaisical-Security/Lackadaisical-Security/issues/new)
   - Title: `[GHOST PROTOCOL] Supporter Recognition - [Your Handle]`
   - Include:
     - Amount donated (USD equivalent)
     - Transaction hash (or "Monero - Private")
     - Preferred handle/pseudonym
     - Desired tier
     - Confirm you want to be listed in CRYPTO_SPONSORS.md
   
2. We verify on-chain for BTC/ETH/LTC (honor system for Monero 👻)

3. You're added to [CRYPTO_SPONSORS.md](CRYPTO_SPONSORS.md) as a recognized supporter

**Option 2: Stay Fully Anonymous**

Just donate and watch the research flourish. No credit needed, no recognition required.

---

### The Clarity:

**Financial support ≠ Research credit**

- Museum patrons don't get credit for the art
- Academic grants don't make funders co-authors
- Ghost Protocol supporters don't claim decipherment credit

**You enable the work. The researchers claim the discoveries.**

This keeps the research integrity intact while honoring those who make it possible.

## 💬 The Distinction

**You're supporting the research, not claiming it.**

Like a museum patron or academic grant - you enable the work, but the discoveries remain credited to the researchers.

**This is how it should be.**

*"Support the mission. Let the researchers claim the credit. Ghost Protocol."*
